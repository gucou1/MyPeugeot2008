## PowerBI dashboard

Made this dashboard to follow-up on my car's app metrics and get some practice out of it!
Also, I can extract some information on how much I'm spending in gas. Should I be saving even more?

I can see lots of data missing and I assume this is because I forgot to sync my app with the car's system.
Hopefully, as I keep on updating this dashboard, no data will be left out and I can follow up on my car's journey
